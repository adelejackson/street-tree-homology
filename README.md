# Street Tree Homology
Analysing the persistent homology of street tree locations in NYC and SF

Written at the AMSI Summer School 2018 for a course in Topological Data Analysis run by Katherine Turner 
and Vanessa Robins.
We examine the persistent homology of street tree location samples in NYC and SF, hypothesising that the 
regular local level structure of NYC will cause statistically significant differents to the persistent 
homology of the SF samples.

Dependencies: [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/), [MatPlotLib](https://matplotlib.org/), 
[Dionysus](http://mrzv.org/software/dionysus2/), [Diode](https://github.com/mrzv/diode).

[One file](visualise_street_trees.py) requires [HoloViews](http://holoviews.org/).

Much of the code is based on Katherine Turner's examples, and the rank function calculation on code 
provided by Vanessa Robins.
